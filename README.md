## What is the Pomodoro Technique?

The [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) is a renowned time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo. It's designed to enhance focus and productivity by dividing work into short, timed intervals called "Pomodoros". This cycle of working and resting not only helps to maintain high levels of productivity but also prevents burnout by ensuring regular rest periods. The technique's simplicity and effectiveness in breaking down work into manageable chunks make it widely adopted among professionals and students alike, aiming to optimize their workday and tackle tasks with increased efficiency.

## How does it work?

1. **Choose a Task** you want to work on.
2. **Initiate a Pomodoro** for each task, typically set to 25 mins. Tailor the timer's duration to suit your specific needs.
3. **Work on the task** until the timer rings.
4. **Take a Short Break** to relax and reset (5-10 mins). This helps to ensure that your brain remains fresh for the next round.
5. **Repeat** the process, and after completing four Pomodoros, take a longer break (15–30 mins) to recharge more significantly.
